# Audit wheel is required to convert a wheel that is tagged as generic
# 'linux' into a 'multilinux' wheel.
# Only wheel files tagged as multilinux can be uploaded to PyPI
# Audit wheel will make sure no external dependencies are needed for
# the shared library and that only symbols supported by most linux
# distributions are used.
